# Algorithms
this project contains examples of basic algorithms to help me understand them better

## Linear search
sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched

## Binary search
finds the position of a target value within a sorted array

## Depth first search
traversing algorithm that starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking

## Breadth first search
traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph layerwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes
